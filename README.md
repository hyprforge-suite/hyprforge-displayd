# hyprforge-displayd

A monitor-arrangement daemon for Hyprland, and `hyprforge-displayctl` to
drive it from a script.

It watches `wlr-output-management`, recognises a set of displays it has
seen before, and applies the layout you saved for that set. Plug the same
dock in tomorrow and the monitors come back arranged the way you left
them. It owns `dev.hyprforge.Displayd` on the session bus and serves the
`dev.hyprforge.Displayd1` interface there, which is what
`hyprforge-displayctl` (and Hyprforge's Settings app and tray) talk to,
and writes the settled layout out as a static `monitors.lua` so it
still applies when the daemon is not running.

Part of [Hyprforge](https://github.com/hyprforge-suite/hyprforge), a suite of
native Hyprland desktop applications. It appears there as a
submodule at `crates/hyprforge-displayd`; this repository is where its code
lives, and pull requests here are welcome.

## Two things worth knowing before reading the code

**Scales are 120ths, and most of the ones you would want do not exist.**
Hyprland rounds an incoming scale to the nearest 120th, so 1.5 is 180/120
and 1.6 is 192/120 — and then rejects any scale that does not divide the
mode cleanly, substituting its own; the failure is a layout that
silently does not apply. `matching.rs` snaps every scale to one the
panel can really take before planning a layout around it. The
monorepo's README has the full account under "Scales are 120ths".

**A saved layout is keyed on a fingerprint, not on connector names.**
`DP-1` is whichever port something is plugged into today. The
fingerprint is a hash of the set of EDID identities (make, model,
serial) — see `fingerprint.rs`. Two identical monitors report identical
identities, so which one gets which saved position cannot come from
EDID alone: `matching.rs` falls back to connector order, then applies
any swap you saved for that pair.

## Installing

```
cargo install --path .
```

Arch users can build the `hyprforge-displayd` package from the monorepo's
`packaging/arch` instead, which also installs the systemd user service.
